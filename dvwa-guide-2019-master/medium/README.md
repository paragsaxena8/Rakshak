# README for DVWA, "Medium" Security Setting
<i>If you haven't already, please review my terms and conditions <a href=https://github.com/mrudnitsky/dvwa-guide-2019/blob/master/README.md target="_blank">here</a>.</i>
<br><br>
This folder is for the "medium mode" challenges, where the app's Security Level is set to "medium". This means that there are basic security measures in place, but that they are generally ineffective or circumventable. You can set this in <b>/dvwa/security.php</b>.
<br><br>
My details are as follows:
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Hostname:</b> http://dvwa/</li>
  <li><b>DVWA directory:</b> /dvwa/</li>
  <li><b>Full root directory:</b> http://dvwa/dvwa/</li>
  <li><b>Kali working directory:</b> /root/Desktop/</li>
</ol>

I may list paths in a relative sense. For example, I may reference the full URL of <b>http&#58;&#47;&#47;dvwa/dvwa/login.php</b> as <b>/dvwa/login.php</b>. 
<br><br>
Starting at this tier of difficulty, I'm going to assume you know the basics of pentesting and aren't a complete noob :) Due to most of our comprehensive background and analysis occuring in the <a href="https://github.com/mrudnitsky/dvwa-guide-2019/tree/master/low" target="_blank"> easy mode section</a>, most of these guides will focus on the specific countermeasures in play in this mode and how to circumvent them. I'll only be dealing with intricacies related to each specific challenge without going into detail about specific operations, configuration, or methodology. To assist with this, these challenges will stay white-box.
<br><br>
Don't forget, there is a help/hint guide for each challenge built into the app. It's always located at the bottom right corner of each challenge's main page. You may need to scroll down to see it. They're well-written and incredibly useful.
